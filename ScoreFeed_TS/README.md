# ScoreFeed_TS
The TypeScript-version of ScoreFeed
<br />

# What is this?

To put it simply, ScoreFeed_TS hooks into the ScoreSaber Websocket for their [Scores-page](https://scoresaber.com/scores), and with some configuration, it posts the desired scores to a Discord-textchannel: <br />

# How to run

Run `npm install` or `yarn` in the `ScoreFeedTS`-folder

Configure `.env`

Run `npm run prod` or `yarn prod` in the `ScoreFeed_TS`-folder

# Why doesn't my buttons show?

Use a webhook generated by a **BOT**, else they won't show. [Guide here](https://hookdeck.com/webhooks/platforms/tutorial-how-to-configure-discord-webhooks-using-the-api)
