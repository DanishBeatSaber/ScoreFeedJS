# ScoreFeedJS
The Scorefeed-code originally made for #scores-feed on Dane Saber Discord
<br />

# What is this?

To put it simply, ScoreFeedJS hooks into the ScoreSaber Websocket for their [Scores-page](https://scoresaber.com/scores), and with some configuration, it posts the desired scores to a Discord-textchannel: <br />

# Why doesn't my buttons show?
